# Veri-Simple

## Overview
Veri-Simple is a collection of Verilog code examples aimed at beginners or anyone interested in learning Verilog through hands-on practice. These examples are drawn from my university homework assignments and feature detailed comments and explanations to enhance understanding.

## Features
- **Decoders**
- **Multiplexers (MUXes)**
- **Adders**
- **Subtractors**
- Many other beginner-friendly circuits designed to run on the Cyclone V board.

Each example includes comprehensive comments that guide you through the Verilog code, making it easier to grasp how Verilog designs are structured and function in real hardware.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mariam-Katamashvili/Veri-Simple.git
2. Navigate to the example you are interested in and review the source files.
3. Load the Verilog files onto your Cyclone V board environment to test and experiment with the circuits.
